</p>

<p>
Too create a new role. There is a button labeled “Add New Role”. It brought up a prompt and I created the role of “Supreme Admin”.

</p>

<p>
Then after I created roles I created new departments.

</p>

<p>
I added a new team so that tickets can be elevated when needed.

</p>

<p>
I then added agents that can sign into osTicket. Some had administrative privileges and others didn't. With these new agents I was able to edit SLA. or comment on the ticket that the problem was being worked on. It gave me a true understanding of how an actual work environment would feel like.

<p>
I then created new users. In the end users portal I can submit a new ticket.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I created different priorities categories called SLA. The administrative agents can use these to let other team members know the severity of the tickets.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I created new help topics so the user can better describe the problem they are experiencing. In turn my agents can more efficiently solve their problems.
